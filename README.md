This is my first game with JavaScript. It is a numbers game that I played as a child with my childhood friends.

It is played by two people.

The first Person chooses a 4-digit number, with the condition that It must not repeat the numbers: 
Ex: 7345 (No 4354). The four numbers must be different.

The second person tries to guess that number.

To do this, He or She must choose 4 numbers and the Game tells him or her how many of those numbers are Well Located or Only Well. 

Ex:

Person A chooses the number #1234

Person B tries to guess and writes the number #1278. 

The game tells that, based on his choice, there are 2 "Well Located" Numbers (1 and 2 are Well Located in their correct position).

Person B Refresh the page and this time chooses the number #3478. 

The game tells that, as a result of the choice, there are 2 Well Numbers. Only "Well", since 3 and 4 are "Well", but not "Well Located" in their correct position.

This continues until the 4-digit number is guessed. 
Making deductions.
